Basic Physics Formula
Some basic but very important Physics formula is given below:

1) Average Speed Formula:
The average speed is the average of speed of a moving body for the overall distance that it has covered.

S = dt
Where,

S	Average speed
d	Total distance traveled
t	Total time is taken



2) Acceleration Formula:
Acceleration is defined as the rate of change in velocity to the change in time. It is denoted by symbol a.

a =v−ut

where,

a	Acceleration
v	Final Velocity
u	Initial Velocity
t	Time taken



3) Density Formula:
The density of material shows the denseness of it in a specific given area.

ρ=mV

Where,

ρ	Density
m	Mass of the body
V	The volume of the body



 4) Newton’s Second Law:
According to Newton’s second law of motion, the force can be expressed by the product of mass and acceleration of the body.

F = m ×  a

Where,

F	Force
m	Mass of the body
a	Acceleration in velocity available



5) Power Formula:
The capacity to do some work is termed as Energy. The Energy spent to do work in a unit amount of time is termed as Power.

P=Wt

Where,

P	Power
W	Work done
t	Time taken
