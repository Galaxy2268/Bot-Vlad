6) Weight Formula:
Weight is not anything but the force which an object experiences due to gravity.

W=mg

Where,

W	Weight
m	Mass of the body
g	Acceleration due to gravity



7) Pressure Formula:
The pressure is defined as the amount of force applied per unit area of the object.

P=FA

Where,

P	Pressure
F	Force applied
A	Total Area of the object



8) Kinetic Energy formula:
Kinetic energy is the energy that is possessed by a body due to its state of motion.

E = 12mv2 

Where,

E	Kinetic Energy
m	Mass of the body
v	The velocity with which the body is traveling



 9) Ohms Law Formula:
Ohms law says that the current running through some conductor material is directly proportional to the potential difference between two endpoints of the conductor.

V= I × R

Where,

V	Voltage measured in Volts
I	Electric current flowing through the conductor in amperes.
R	The resistance of the material in ohms.



10) Frequency Formula:
Frequency is the revolutions completed per second or as the number of wave cycles.

f= Vλ

Where,

f	Frequency of the wave
V	Velocity or wave speed
λ	The wavelength of the wave
